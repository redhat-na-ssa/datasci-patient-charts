# Patient Charts
This repository contains jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to prepare PDF patient chart data for LLM ingestion using unstructured.ai apis.

Please note that this code is based on the code shown in the Coursera Course: Preprocessing Unstructured Data for LLM Applications, which was released March 2024.



Note:  to run this demo you will need unstructured.ai's DLAI_API_KEY and access to their chipper model (DLAI_API_URL)
